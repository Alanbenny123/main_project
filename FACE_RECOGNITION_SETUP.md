# Face Recognition Setup Guide ðŸ‘¤

Complete guide for setting up face recognition to identify students in classroom videos.

## Overview

The system uses **OpenCV's LBPH Face Recognizer** to:
1. Detect faces in classroom videos
2. Identify which student each face belongs to
3. Track individual behaviors for each student
4. Generate per-student reports

## Installation

### 1. Install OpenCV with Face Recognition

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

This includes the face recognition module needed for LBPH.

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__); print(hasattr(cv2, 'face'))"
```

Should output the version and `True`.

## Enrolling Students

### Method 1: Using the Web UI (Recommended)

1. Start the application
2. Go to **Face Enrollment** tab
3. Enter Student ID and Name
4. Click "Start Face Capture"
5. Capture 5-10 face samples (different angles, expressions)
6. Click "Enroll" to save

**Tips for good enrollment:**
- Face the camera directly
- Capture at different angles (slight left, right, up, down)
- Use good lighting
- Avoid glasses/masks if possible (or capture with/without)
- Capture different expressions

### Method 2: Using Python Script

```bash
python face_recognition_system.py
```

Follow the prompts to enroll students via webcam.

### Method 3: Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/face/enroll \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "student_id": "S001",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "face_images": ["base64_image1", "base64_image2", ...]
  }'
```

## Using Full Classroom Analysis

### Live Classroom Analysis:

1. **Enroll all students** using Face Enrollment tab
2. Go to **Full Classroom** tab
3. Point camera at the classroom
4. Click "Start Classroom Analysis"
5. System detects all faces and identifies students
6. Real-time behavior tracking for each student
7. Click "Stop & Save All Reports" to save individual reports

### Analyzing Classroom Video:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analyze-classroom-video \
  -F "file=@classroom_video.mp4"
```

Returns per-student behavior analysis:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "student_data": {
    "S001": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "behavior_stats": [
        {"label": "Reading", "count": 45, "percentage": 75},
        {"label": "Writing", "count": 15, "percentage": 25}
      ]
    },
    "S002": { ... }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Face Detection

Uses **Haar Cascade** (fast, good for real-time):
- Detects faces in each frame
- Returns bounding boxes for each face

### 2. Face Recognition

Uses **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)**:
- Extracts unique patterns from face
- Compares with enrolled students
- Returns student ID if match found

### 3. Behavior Prediction

For each detected face:
- Extracts face region + surrounding context
- Runs through behavior detection model
- Assigns behavior label

### 4. Tracking

- Maintains per-student session data
- Counts behaviors for each student
- Generates individual reports

## Face Recognition Files

```
student_faces/          # Face image storage
â”œâ”€â”€ S001/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ face_0.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ face_1.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ S002/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...

face_encodings.pkl      # Trained model metadata
face_recognizer_model.yml  # LBPH model weights
```

## API Endpoints

### Enrollment
```
POST /api/face/enroll
  - Enroll student face samples

GET /api/face/enrolled
  - List enrolled students

GET /api/face/status
  - Check system status
```

### Analysis
```
POST /api/analyze-classroom-frame
  - Analyze single frame with multiple students

POST /api/analyze-classroom-video
  - Process full classroom video
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "module 'cv2' has no attribute 'face'"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.5.64
```

### Poor Recognition Accuracy

**Solutions:**
1. Enroll more face samples (8-10 per student)
2. Capture faces in different lighting conditions
3. Ensure good camera quality
4. Re-train after adding more samples

### Face Not Detected

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure good lighting
2. Face camera directly
3. Remove obstructions (hair, hands, etc.)
4. Adjust `minNeighbors` in face detector settings

### Wrong Student Identified

**Solutions:**
1. Add more diverse face samples
2. Check if students look similar
3. Lower confidence threshold for stricter matching
4. Re-enroll with better quality images

## Advanced Configuration

### Adjust Face Detection Sensitivity

In `face_recognition_system.py`:

```python
# For more sensitive detection (more false positives)
faces = detector.detectMultiScale(
    gray,
    scaleFactor=1.05,  # Lower = more sensitive
    minNeighbors=3,    # Lower = more detections
    minSize=(20, 20)   # Smaller = detect smaller faces
)

# For less sensitive (fewer false positives)
faces = detector.detectMultiScale(
    gray,
    scaleFactor=1.3,
    minNeighbors=7,
    minSize=(50, 50)
)
```

### Adjust Recognition Confidence

```python
# In identify_face() method
# Lower threshold = stricter matching
confidence_threshold = 80  # Default: 100

# Lower confidence value = better match
# Typical range: 50-100
```

## Performance Tips

### For Better Speed:
- Use Haar Cascade detection (current default)
- Process every Nth frame (sample_rate=30)
- Reduce video resolution
- Use GPU acceleration if available

### For Better Accuracy:
- Switch to DNN face detector
- Process more frames (lower sample_rate)
- Use higher resolution video
- Enroll more face samples

## Workflow Example

### Full Classroom Session:

1. **Setup (One Time)**
```bash
# Start application
python app.py

# Enroll all students via web UI
# - Go to Face Enrollment tab
# - Enroll S001, S002, S003, etc.
```

2. **Analysis Session**
```bash
# Go to Full Classroom tab
# Point camera at classroom
# Click Start Classroom Analysis
# System tracks all students in real-time
```

3. **Review Reports**
```bash
# Go to Reports tab
# Enter each student ID to view their report
# See engagement scores, behavior distribution
```

## Benefits of Face Recognition

âœ… **Multi-Student Tracking**: Analyze entire classroom at once
âœ… **Individual Reports**: Separate reports for each student
âœ… **Automatic Identification**: No manual tagging needed
âœ… **Scalable**: Works with any number of enrolled students
âœ… **Privacy-Focused**: Faces stored locally, not in cloud

## Security & Privacy

- Face data stored locally only
- No external API calls
- Can be deleted anytime (`rm -rf student_faces/`)
- GDPR compliant (with proper consent)
- Recommend student/parent consent before enrollment

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Enroll all students in your classroom
2. âœ… Test with individual students first
3. âœ… Try full classroom analysis
4. âœ… Review and refine based on accuracy
5. âœ… Generate reports for parents/teachers
